# church-calendar
This is a Python script which generates Greek Catholic calendar of saints.

Repository includes Python script itself and necessary files with data for every day.

To generate calendar correctly you need to specify a year which you want to generate the calendar for and Easter date for that year. So far these parameters are hardcoded at the top of the script.
